# AIM OF PROJECT:
This is an NLP Based project which aims to classify 6 emotions (Joy, Saddness, Anger, Love, Fear and Suprise) using **Bidirectional LSTMs**.
It is an advancement of a simple Sentiment Analysis Project which has the capacity to classify whether the text is Positive, Negative or Neutral using Naive Bayes Theorem.

## Clone Project By Running Command in Terminal:
